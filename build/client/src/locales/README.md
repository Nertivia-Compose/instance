# How To Translate
## Tooling
If you're using Visual Studio Code, i'd recommend [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally)   
You can also take a look at more tools to make translating easier [here](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/tooling.html) (Under the "3rd party tooling" tag).

## How?
1. Clone the en.json file and rename it accordingly.
2. Translate all of the end values of each of the key.
3. Open the languages.json file and add a new entry.
4. Submit a PR.
